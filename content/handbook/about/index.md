# About the handbook

## History of the handbook

> Well actually, we did a full blown wiki instead of just the team handbook. The last thing you worry about experiencing (autistic) burnout is the succession plan. - @ajhalili2006

Since Recap Time Squad is currently an one-man operation (and obviously not a company), it is important for ~ajhalili2006 (our [SABDFL(../)]) to have everything about the squad being documented in case of [being hit by a bus](https://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/but-what-about-the-bus-factor/)
or (hopefully this don't happen but that's the worst case scenario) [die by suicide (as a high risk individual)](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/hidden-danger-suicide-autism/).[^1]

[^1]: That's depressing for some, but as an neurodivergent person, it's a unholy mess of trauma and mental health issues.

Most parts of the handbook are adopted from the [GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com), licensed under MIT.

## Handbook Interpretation

The handbook is subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or misinterpretation. We also recognize that we have a global audience and that may bring different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please reach out and ask.

**Remember that [everything is in draft](./values.md#everything-is-in-draft) at Recap Time Squad and subject to change, this includes our handbook.**
