The new home for squad's organizational wiki and the handbook itself, built with [Material theme for Mkdocs](https://material-theme.mkdocs.lorebooks.eu.org)[^3].

[^3]: That's just a project wiki redirect for `mkdocs-material` PyPi package on our side, will be enabled soon.

If you're a squad member (or someone who get allowlisted for access) and you need the internal version, [sign in here](https://internal.squad.lorebooks.eu.org) or [learn more in handbook](https://squad.lorebooks.eu.org/go/internal-handbook).

## Where it's been deployed

We use Netlify to host stuff, although we use GitLab CI to do the deployment itself.
The website is accessible at [`squad.lorebooks.eu.org`](https://squad.lorebooks.eu.org) [^2] while we're ironing out
the migration plan until further notice.[^1]
